MinMaCons is a new icons pack, which is the non-background (Non-BG) version of Minma Icon Pack (Free). These icons are designed with simplicity and minimalism in mind, tailored for Android phones.

**Note:** This is the initial release, so the number of icons is limited. However, more unique icons will be added in the next update. Please bear in mind that I'm not a professional designer, and some icons may look different, but I'm committed to improving them. If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact me before rating the icon pack.

## Features
- Total 1120+ Icons for now
- Resolution is 200x200px
- License Checker
